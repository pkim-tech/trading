# Trading Alpha Engine

## Session Commands
- `go` — session start: read the first ~60 lines of `docs/session_cache.md` and give a brief summary of where we left off and what's next.
- `session close` — session end: write the session summary to two places: (1) prepend to `docs/session_cache.md` (insert after the header, before existing entries; keep only the 10 most recent entries, drop older ones — this file is gitignored, not committed), and (2) append the same summary to `docs/conversation_summary.md` (permanent, uncapped, committed — this is the durable record, since entries dropped from session_cache.md are not recoverable). Commit only `docs/conversation_summary.md`. No tests, no skills. If context is low and reading the file first is not feasible, write the summary to a new file `docs/session_cache_new.md` instead.
- `feature wrap` — mid-session feature complete: update relevant docs, review pre-commit checklist (`docs/pre_commit_checklist.md`) manually, and commit. Does not trigger session close. **Do not invoke any skills (especially verify) during this command.**
- `session wrap` — in order: (1) update relevant docs, (2) review pre-commit checklist manually, (3) write the session summary to both `docs/session_cache.md` (prepend, cap 10) and `docs/conversation_summary.md` (append, uncapped), (4) commit everything including both files. **Do not invoke any skills.**

## Project Overview
A z-score mean reversion backtesting and optimization system targeting leveraged ETFs. Runs parallel grid sweeps over take profit, stop loss, and hold time parameters to find optimal strategy configurations with positive alpha vs SPY. Now in live trading phase with manual execution via Schwab.

## Live Trading — Current State
- **Watchlist**: Sweep 3 (v3.x) (`watchlist_id=7`), promoted to active/live 2026-07-05, replacing the old v1.x `main` watchlist. 10 tickers:
  - `TrailingExitZScoreBreakout` v3.18 (bar-close entry, trailing exit): NUGT, SOXL, TQQQ
  - `TrailingBothZScoreBreakout` v3.21-27 (trailing entry — place a broker trailing-buy order at `trail_buy_pct`%, broker handles fill timing — + trailing exit): AGQ, DPST, EDC, GDXU, HIBL, KORU, YANG
  - All use `fixed_sl=15%` (real stop loss, config-driven constant, not swept) and z-score thresholds 1.0-1.5 per ticker — see `watch_list` table for exact per-ticker window/take_profit/hold/trail_buy_pct/trail_pct.
- **Signal windows**: 10:25–10:40 AM ET and 15:25–15:40 PM ET (matches backtest target_hours=(9,14))
- **Execution workflow**:
  - `TrailingExitZScoreBreakout`: Stage limit order pre-market at absurd low price → Slack fires at bar close if price confirmed below lower_band → edit order to market and submit (~5 seconds).
  - `TrailingBothZScoreBreakout`: same bar-close signal fires the alert, but place a **trailing buy order at `trail_buy_pct`%** instead of a market order — the broker tracks the bounce-above-running-low entry itself (live code does not simulate this state machine).
  - 🔶 in morning report = set phone alarm for 10:28 and 15:28.
- **Stop loss**: Schwab stop order at lower_band × (1 - (SL%+1%)) — 1% buffer over backtest SL for intraday protection. Real exit is triggered by Slack SELL signal at bar close, not the Schwab stop (which is catastrophic insurance only).
- **Position sizing**: $50k notional per trade. Share count shown in BUY Slack message.
- **Entry price**: Real-time via `yfinance fast_info.last_price` at signal check time.

## Key Files
- `app.py` — Streamlit UI for configuring and launching optimization sweeps
- `run_optimization_sweep.py` — main parallel optimization engine (brute force + generational refinement)
- `backtester.py` — core backtest simulation logic (`run_backtest`)
- `strategies.py` — strategy classes: `ZScoreBreakout`, `TrendFilteredZScore`
- `data_collector.py` — fetches and caches hourly price data
- `data_manager.py` — data fetching and cache management
- `config.json` — runtime config: tickers, hyperparameters, strategy selection
- `pages/` — Streamlit multipage app views (Spatial Topology, Node Inspector)

## Runtime Artifacts (not committed)
- `cache/` — hourly CSV data per ticker + SQLite results DB (`trading_universe.db`)
- `logs/` — optimization output PNGs, CSVs, text reports
- `output/` — archived/legacy files
- `active_phase_grid.json` — live progress state written during sweep runs
- `current_test.json` — temp telemetry file, deleted on sweep exit

## How to Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Streamlit UI
streamlit run app.py

# Or run optimization sweep directly
python run_optimization_sweep.py
```

## Architecture Notes
- Optimization uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` with up to 10 workers
- Results cached in SQLite to avoid re-running completed nodes
- Multi-generation refinement: macro grid scan → frontier detection → fine mesh around top performers
- `active_phase_grid.json` is written by the sweep and read by the Streamlit UI for live progress display
