# Design Document — Trading Alpha Engine

## Architecture Overview

Three discrete layers, each independently runnable:

1. **Data Collection** — daemon fetches and caches hourly OHLCV data
2. **Parameter Optimization** — brute force search for robust alpha islands
3. **Active Signals** — apply optimized params to current market state, surface entries/exits (planned)

---

## Layer 1 — Data Collection

- `data_collector.py` polls every 5 minutes, calls `data_manager.py` for incremental updates
- Data stored as `cache/{ticker}_1h.csv`, SPY always included as benchmark
- Incremental backfill with deduplication — overlapping buffer handles weekends/holidays
- Ticker universe defined in `tickers.json` — plain JSON array, read at startup
- Cron job runs `data_collector.py --once` daily at 6:30 AM via `scripts/run_data_collector.sh`, logs to `logs/data_collector_daily.log` (runs before 7 AM morning report so bands are fresh)

---

## Layer 2 — Parameter Optimization

### Strategy
Z-score mean reversion: buy when price deviates significantly below the rolling SMA, exit at take profit, stop loss, or max hold time.

Strategy variants:
- `ZScoreBreakout` — pure z-score entry, close-based fill (v1.5/v1.6)
- `TrendFilteredZScore` — z-score with 50d SMA trend filter overlay
- `LimitOrderZScoreBreakout` — limit entry at `lower_band` (fill on `Low <= lower_band` intrabar); intrabar stop loss checks `Low <= stop_price`; TP checks `Close >= tp_price` at bar close (v1.7)
- `TrailingExitZScoreBreakout` — close-based entry (v1.5 style); once `Close >= tp_price`, switches to trailing mode: tracks `peak = max(High)`, exits when `Low <= peak × (1 - trail_pct)`. Replaces SL once trailing is active (v1.8, experimental)

### Optimization Approach

The optimizer searches for **winning islands** — regions of the (take profit, stop loss, hold time) parameter space where many neighboring nodes all produce positive alpha vs SPY. A single isolated peak is fragile; a broad plateau is robust.

**Evolution of the search approach:**
1. Smart grid search with generational refinement around alpha peaks
2. Fine-mesh adjustment around top performers — abandoned due to floating point precision issues on parameter adjustments
3. Full brute force — all nodes in the space, cached in SQLite. ~18k nodes per ticker, runs overnight. More reliable and gives a complete topology view.

### Key Components
- `run_optimization_sweep.py` — orchestrates the sweep, manages worker pool, writes progress to `active_phase_grid.json` (planned nodes) and `current_test.json` (live telemetry)
- `backtester.py` — single node evaluation. Three kernels: `_simulate` (close-based, v1.5/v1.6), `_simulate_limit` (limit entry + intrabar SL, v1.7), `_simulate_trail` (close entry + trailing exit, v1.8). Corresponding wrappers: `run_backtest`, `run_backtest_v17`, `run_backtest_v18`. Sweep engine and Node Inspector dispatch to the correct wrapper based on strategy class.
- `strategies.py` — strategy class definitions. `z_score_threshold` stored in `self.params`, used in `check_signal` for live signal detection. The sweep and Node Inspector both pass it to `run_backtest` explicitly.
- `pages/1_Spatial_Topology.py` — 4D Plotly scatter of parameter space, shows planned nodes in blue and completed nodes colored by alpha
- `pages/2_Node_Inspector.py` — re-runs backtest for a selected node, shows trade ledger and quarterly breakdown; Hurst/ADF analysis is opt-in (checkbox), lazy-loaded on demand
- `pages/4_Portfolio.py` — portfolio backtester with two node sources: (1) watchlist toggle, (2) DB research nodes (filter by version/alpha/trades/z). Gantt timeline + SPY/TQQQ overlay + concurrent positions panel. Hurst/ADF overlay removed (not actionable).
- `cache/trading_universe.db` — SQLite cache, nodes never re-evaluated once computed
- `config.json` — single source of truth for runtime config. `app.py` reads/writes directly — DB copy removed.

### Performance
- `ProcessPoolExecutor` with up to 10 workers (configurable via `execution.max_workers`)
- Phase 2 runs `execution.max_generations` times (default 1), re-centering island mesh on refined peaks each generation
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent writes
- L3 cache optimization identified as next performance improvement (suggested by Gemini)
- Sweep auto-runs `refresh_dropdown_cache()` + `refresh_pivot_cache()` on completion
- Cron job runs sweep daily at 4:15am

## Layer 3 — Active Signals

`active_signals.py` — polls price data, fires BUY/SELL alerts to console and Slack. Fetches fresh data for all watched tickers at the start of each poll cycle — no separate data collector process needed.

- **Multi-watchlist**: `watchlists` DB table (id, name, is_active). One list is designated active — that's what the signal loop monitors. Same node can exist in multiple lists (UNIQUE constraint is scoped per list).
- **Node mode**: `watch_list.mode` — `live` fires full Slack BUY alerts; `research` logs signal to console only (no Slack, no position tracking).
- `watch_list` DB table — nodes selected for monitoring, scoped to a watchlist
- `open_positions` DB table — tracks entries pending exit
- Entry/exit logic delegated to strategy classes in `strategies.py` — no signal logic in `active_signals.py`
- **Slack Socket Mode** — bot token + app token; BUY/SELL messages have interactive Executed/Skipped buttons, price entry modal, chart image upload
- **BUY message** — shows market price, share count at $50k notional, and max notional / max shares at 1% of avg daily vol (liquidity ceiling from `tickers` table)
- **Morning report** — fires at startup and daily at 7 AM ET; shows current price (via `yfinance history prepost=True`), overnight change vs last daily close, trigger proximity, TP/SL prices, z-score, and data date (last daily bar used for bands)
- **Current price** — uses `yfinance history(period='1d', interval='1m', prepost=True)` to capture pre/post-market; falls back to cached hourly close on failure
- Signal indicators use prior closed day's SMA/Std (not today's intraday close) — matches live trading semantics
- `--ticker TICKER` flag to filter the poll loop to specific tickers
- No brokerage integration — manual execution
- `scripts/live_test.py` — synthetic TEST ticker for end-to-end Socket Mode testing

### Winners Page

`pages/3_Winners.py` — Streamlit leaderboard of top nodes per ticker per z_score_threshold for a selected version.

- Filters: version, ticker, strategy, z_score_threshold multiselect, min trades, min alpha, beat asset B&H toggle, top N per ticker per threshold
- Groups by `(ticker, z_score_threshold)` — allows direct comparison of z=2.0 vs z=2.5 vs z=3.0 best nodes side by side
- Dismiss per `(ticker, strategy, version)` — persisted to `cache/dismissed_tickers.json`
- Click row → Watch / Dismiss / Open in Node Inspector actions
- Open in Node Inspector passes all params (window, TP, SL, hold, z_score_threshold) via session state — dropdowns auto-select on arrival
- Sidebar watchlist picker — create/delete/set-active named lists; active list drives signal loop
- Watch list table at bottom with inline label editing, mode toggle (live/research), and remove-by-uncheck

### Sweep Status Page

`pages/5_Sweep_Status.py` — per-ticker sweep progress for a selected version. Shows nodes cached vs expected, SUCCESS vs NO_TRADES counts, last data date, ASCII progress bar. Auto-refreshes every 30s. Useful for monitoring long-running sweeps and diagnosing gaps.

### Strategy Page

`pages/6_Strategy.py` — renders `docs/strategy.md` in the app. Living reference for signal logic, edge cases, and trading rules.

### Hurst Filter Page

`pages/7_Hurst_Filter.py` — sweeps Hurst cutoff across all qualifying watchlist nodes. Compares MR (mean-reverting, H<cutoff) vs MO (momentum, H≥cutoff) entry filters. Result: not actionable — see `docs/research.md`.

### ADF Filter Page

`pages/8_ADF_Filter.py` — same structure for ADF p-value filter. Non-stationary (p≥cutoff) vs stationary entries. See `docs/research.md`.

### Shared Modules

- `hurst.py` — `_hurst_vectorized` + `ROLLING_WINDOW=200`. Imported by Node Inspector and `active_signals.py`.

### Screener Page

`pages/4_Screener.py` — filter the full ticker universe before deciding what to sweep.

- Reads from `tickers` table in `cache/trading_universe.db`
- Filters: symbol/name search, AUM, dollar volume liquidity (investment × multiplier), leverage (2x/3x), inverse toggle, single-stock underlier toggle, has-data toggle, underlying index search, performance
- Columns: stock_underlier, index_underlier, leverage, inverse, has_data, price, dollar vol, AUM, performance, signals
- "Add to config.json" button adds selected tickers to `target_tickers` for the next sweep

### Open Positions Page

`pages/10_Open_Positions.py` — live view of manually entered positions tracked in `open_positions` DB table.

- Reads from `open_positions` in `cache/trading_universe.db`
- Fetches current price via `yfinance fast_info.last_price` at page load
- Shows: signal price, entry price, drift % (entry vs signal), current price, unrealized P&L%, TP price, SL price, hours held, hours remaining until time-exit, entry time
- TP = entry_price × (1 + tp%), SL = entry_price × (1 - sl%) — display only, Schwab stop is set separately at lower_band × (1 - (sl%+1%))
- Manual refresh button; no auto-refresh

### Ticker Universe Table

`tickers` table in `cache/trading_universe.db` — populated by `scripts/import_tickers.py` from screener CSV exports.

- Key derived columns: `leverage` (parsed from description), `inverse` (from fund type/description), `has_data` (cache CSV exists), `stock_underlier` / `index_underlier` (classified from underlying index + description)
- Re-run `python scripts/import_tickers.py <file.csv>` to replace with a new screener export

See `docs/strategy_architecture.md` for the target node/strategy data model (deferred until second strategy is added).

## Future — Live Trading Engine

If a brokerage API key is added (e.g. Alpaca, IBKR), Layer 3 can be extended to:
- Submit orders automatically on signal trigger
- Track open positions via broker API (not manual state)
- Handle fills, partial fills, and slippage reporting
- End-of-day reconciliation against broker blotter
