# Design Document — Trading Alpha Engine

## Architecture Overview

Three discrete layers, each independently runnable:

1. **Data Collection** — daemon fetches and caches hourly OHLCV data
2. **Parameter Optimization** — brute force search for robust alpha islands
3. **Active Signals** — apply optimized params to current market state, surface entries/exits (planned)

---

## Layer 1 — Data Collection

- `data_collector.py` polls every 5 minutes, calls `data_manager.py` for incremental updates
- Data stored as `cache/{ticker}_1h.csv`, SPY always included as benchmark
- Incremental backfill with deduplication — overlapping buffer handles weekends/holidays

---

## Layer 2 — Parameter Optimization

### Strategy
Z-score mean reversion: buy when price deviates significantly below the rolling SMA, exit at take profit, stop loss, or max hold time.

Two strategy variants:
- `ZScoreBreakout` — pure z-score entry
- `TrendFilteredZScore` — z-score with trend filter overlay

### Optimization Approach

The optimizer searches for **winning islands** — regions of the (take profit, stop loss, hold time) parameter space where many neighboring nodes all produce positive alpha vs SPY. A single isolated peak is fragile; a broad plateau is robust.

**Evolution of the search approach:**
1. Smart grid search with generational refinement around alpha peaks
2. Fine-mesh adjustment around top performers — abandoned due to floating point precision issues on parameter adjustments
3. Full brute force — all nodes in the space, cached in SQLite. ~18k nodes per ticker, runs overnight. More reliable and gives a complete topology view.

### Key Components
- `run_optimization_sweep.py` — orchestrates the sweep, manages worker pool, writes progress to `active_phase_grid.json` (planned nodes) and `current_test.json` (live telemetry)
- `backtester.py` — single node evaluation (`run_backtest`)
- `strategies.py` — strategy class definitions
- `pages/1_Spatial_Topology.py` — 4D Plotly scatter of parameter space, shows planned nodes in blue and completed nodes colored by alpha
- `pages/2_Node_Inspector.py` — re-runs backtest for a selected node, shows trade ledger and quarterly breakdown
- `cache/trading_universe.db` — SQLite cache, nodes never re-evaluated once computed
- `config.json` — single source of truth for runtime config. `app.py` reads/writes directly — DB copy removed.

### Performance
- `ProcessPoolExecutor` with up to 10 workers
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent writes
- L3 cache optimization identified as next performance improvement (suggested by Gemini)

## Layer 3 — Active Signals

`active_signals.py` — polls cached price data, fires BUY/SELL alerts to console and Slack, blocks for execution confirmation. Requires `data_collector.py` running simultaneously to keep price cache fresh.

- `watch_list` DB table — nodes selected for live monitoring
- `open_positions` DB table — tracks entries pending exit
- Entry/exit logic delegated to strategy classes in `strategies.py` — no signal logic in `active_signals.py`
- Slack notifications via incoming webhook (Block Kit); interactive buttons (Socket Mode) planned
- No brokerage integration — manual execution

See `docs/strategy_architecture.md` for the target node/strategy data model (deferred until second strategy is added).

## Future — Live Trading Engine

If a brokerage API key is added (e.g. Alpaca, IBKR), Layer 3 can be extended to:
- Submit orders automatically on signal trigger
- Track open positions via broker API (not manual state)
- Handle fills, partial fills, and slippage reporting
- End-of-day reconciliation against broker blotter
