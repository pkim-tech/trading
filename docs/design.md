# Design Document — Trading Alpha Engine

## Architecture Overview

Three discrete layers, each independently runnable:

1. **Data Collection** — daemon fetches and caches hourly OHLCV data
2. **Parameter Optimization** — brute force search for robust alpha islands
3. **Live Trading Engine** — apply optimized params to live signals (planned)

---

## Layer 1 — Data Collection

- `data_collector.py` polls every 5 minutes, calls `data_manager.py` for incremental updates
- Data stored as `cache/{ticker}_1h.csv`, SPY always included as benchmark
- Incremental backfill with deduplication — overlapping buffer handles weekends/holidays

---

## Layer 2 — Parameter Optimization

### Strategy
Z-score mean reversion: buy when price deviates significantly below the rolling SMA, exit at take profit, stop loss, or max hold time.

Two strategy variants:
- `ZScoreBreakout` — pure z-score entry
- `TrendFilteredZScore` — z-score with trend filter overlay

### Optimization Approach

The optimizer searches for **winning islands** — regions of the (take profit, stop loss, hold time) parameter space where many neighboring nodes all produce positive alpha vs SPY. A single isolated peak is fragile; a broad plateau is robust.

**Evolution of the search approach:**
1. Smart grid search with generational refinement around alpha peaks
2. Fine-mesh adjustment around top performers — abandoned due to floating point precision issues on parameter adjustments
3. Full brute force — all nodes in the space, cached in SQLite. ~18k nodes per ticker, runs overnight. More reliable and gives a complete topology view.

### Key Components
- `run_optimization_sweep.py` — orchestrates the sweep, manages worker pool, writes progress to `active_phase_grid.json` (planned nodes) and `current_test.json` (live telemetry)
- `backtester.py` — single node evaluation (`run_backtest`)
- `strategies.py` — strategy class definitions
- `pages/1_Spatial_Topology.py` — 4D Plotly scatter of parameter space, shows planned nodes in blue and completed nodes colored by alpha
- `pages/2_Node_Inspector.py` — re-runs backtest for a selected node, shows trade ledger and quarterly breakdown
- `cache/trading_universe.db` — SQLite cache, nodes never re-evaluated once computed
- `config.json` — single source of truth for runtime config. `app.py` reads/writes directly — DB copy removed.

### Performance
- `ProcessPoolExecutor` with up to 10 workers
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent writes
- L3 cache optimization identified as next performance improvement (suggested by Gemini)

## Layer 3 — Live Trading Engine (Planned)

Not yet implemented. `live_trading.py` will be built from scratch.

**Planned design:**
- Read optimized parameter sets from Layer 2 SQLite results
- Apply to live intraday signals (z-score against cached hourly data)
- Track open positions across sessions
- Manual state update workflow for end-of-day fills (user updates on return home)
- May support multiple tickers simultaneously with different signal profiles
