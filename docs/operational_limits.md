# Operational Limits

Rules imposed on live trading based on the current phase of the system. These exist because the system is partially manual — limits prevent overexposure while execution, monitoring, and automation are still being built out.

---

## Phase 1 — Manual Execution (Current)

**Characteristics**: Slack signals, manual entry/exit confirmation, no brokerage API, no automated exits.

### Risk Management — First Principle
**Never risk capital that would matter if lost.** Position sizes must be small enough that a complete loss on any single trade, or a simultaneous loss across all open positions, does not materially impact retirement or financial security. Everything else in this document flows from this.

### Position Limits
- **Max simultaneous open positions**: TBD — set based on portfolio backtest analysis (how often do stacked signals occur?)
- **Max notional per trade**: 1% of ticker's avg daily dollar volume (surfaced in Slack BUY message)
- **One node per ticker**: Only one watch list entry per ticker until portfolio-level behavior is validated

### Entry/Exit Action Table — By Strategy

Each strategy has different execution mechanics. Check the strategy name shown in the Slack message against this table before acting — do not assume all signals work like v1.5/v1.6.

General notes that apply everywhere:
- **Signal check windows**: 10:25–10:40 AM ET (9:30 bar close) and 15:25–15:40 PM ET (14:30 bar close), for anything marked "bar-close" below.
- **Data source**: Real-time spot price via `yfinance fast_info.last_price` at signal check time. Hourly cached data used only for indicator computation (SMA, Std).
- **Do not use overnight limit orders at lower_band for bar-close strategies**: Open-fill analysis showed entering at the 9:30 open (before the intrabar decline) is consistently worse than the 10:30 close. A staged limit order edited at signal time is the correct approach.
- **No use for stop-limit orders anywhere in this workflow**: all exits (fixed floor stop, armed trailing stop) must guarantee a fill — a stop-limit risks no fill at all during a fast/gappy move on a leveraged ETF, which defeats the point of a stop at exactly the moment it's needed. The one place a stop-limit could plausibly help (capping slippage on a v1.9/v1.10 trailing-buy entry) isn't offered as a combo order at Schwab (confirmed: no trailing-stop-limit-to-buy). Use plain stop (market) throughout.

| # | Strategy | Signal | Timing | Slack message | Required action |
|---|----------|--------|--------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | `ZScoreBreakout` (v1.5/v1.6) | BUY | bar-close (signal window) | 🟢 BUY — Market — price/shares + 🔴 stop-loss price | Edit pre-staged absurd-low limit → market, submit within ~5 sec. Then place the Schwab stop at the shown price. |
| 2 | `ZScoreBreakout` (v1.5/v1.6) | SELL | bar-close (signal window) | TP: "Cancel Stop Loss — Sell All (Market)". SL: "Check account — stop should have auto-filled". TIME: "Change Stop Loss → Market Close order" | TP → sell now. SL → just verify the resting Schwab stop caught it. TIME → convert to a market-close (EOD) order. |
| 3 | `TrendFilteredZScore` (v1.4) | BUY | bar-close (signal window) | Same as row 1 | Same as row 1 — mechanically identical to ZScoreBreakout, just gated by the extra 50d trend filter. |
| 4 | `TrendFilteredZScore` (v1.4) | SELL | bar-close (signal window) | Same as row 2 | Same as row 2. |
| 5 | `LimitOrderZScoreBreakout` (v1.7) | BUY | all day, continuous (intrabar Low touch) | ✅ "LIMIT FILLED" — price/shares + 🔴 stop price | **No entry action** — this is a real resting limit order at the computed trigger price, not a placeholder; it already filled on its own. Just place the Schwab stop at the shown price. |
| 6 | `LimitOrderZScoreBreakout` (v1.7) | SELL | SL continuous (intrabar); TP/TIME bar-close (signal window) | Same TP/SL/TIME messages as row 2 | Same actions as row 2. SL is a backup confirmation — the real protection is the resting Schwab stop, which should already have fired. |
| 7 | `TrailingExitZScoreBreakout` (v1.8) | BUY | bar-close (signal window) | Same as row 1 | Same as row 1. |
| 8 | `TrailingExitZScoreBreakout` (v1.8) | SELL | SL + trailing-stop continuous (intrabar); TP-activation & TIME bar-close | 🎯 "TRAILING ACTIVATED" (no action, informational) fires once when TP clears. Final exit: 🟢 "TRAILING STOP" or 🔴 "STOP LOSS" or 🔶 "TIME EXIT" | TRAILING ACTIVATED → no action, just confirms state changed. Final exit messages → same actions as row 2 (TRAIL behaves like TP: cancel stop, sell now). |

### Execution Limits
- **Do not enter if you cannot monitor**: If unavailable for the next 2h, skip the signal
- **Exit within one trading day of exit signal**: If you miss the exit signal, close at next morning's open
- **No entries in the last 30 minutes of trading**: Insufficient time to react to same-day TP/SL
- **No early manual exits**: Trust TP/SL/TIME — overriding the system emotionally undermines the backtest alpha. Early exit is only justified for operational reasons (e.g. simultaneous exit overload), not price anxiety.
- **Position sizes must not risk retirement capital**: Keep notional small enough that a full loss on any single position is acceptable. This removes the emotional pressure to exit early.

### Monitoring Limits
- **Max watch list size**: TBD — constrained by how many Slack notifications you can realistically act on per day
- **No new entries when 3+ positions are open**: Until portfolio backtest validates stacked position behavior
- **Close all positions and pause watch list before travel**: If connectivity is uncertain (vacation, cruise, international travel), close open positions and remove tickers from watch list before leaving. Do not rely on Slack being reachable.

## Phase 2 — Automated Exits (Planned)

Exits (TP/SL/TIME) submitted automatically via brokerage API. Entries remain manual.

- Removes the simultaneous-exit operational risk
- Increases safe max simultaneous positions
- Requires brokerage API integration (Alpaca, IBKR, etc.)

---

## Phase 3 — Semi-Automated (Future)

Automated exits + optional automated entries for high-confidence nodes (positive floor alpha, broad alpha island, low execution drift historically).

---

## Open Questions

- What is the right max simultaneous positions for Phase 1? (needs portfolio backtest)
- What is total capital allocation to this strategy vs other uses?
- What is the per-trade notional target? (affects how many positions are needed to deploy capital)
