# Backlog

## High Priority

- **Layer 3 — Active Signals**: `active_signals.py` built. Polls cached price data, fires BUY signal to console + Slack, blocks for execution confirmation. Watch list stored in `watch_list` DB table. Next: trade log table.
- **Winners display per ticker**: Streamlit page (or CLI) that surfaces top-performing nodes per ticker from `backtest_cache` for the current version — to support offline node selection for the watch list.

## Visualization Pages (Streamlit)

- **Trade chart page**: New Streamlit page showing hourly price, SMA/Bollinger bands, buy/sell/exit markers, and alpha scorecard for a selected ticker and parameter set. Should be launchable from Node Inspector. (3D topology and node inspector pages already exist in `pages/`)
- **Topology page — collapsible controls**: Pickers and dropdowns consume too much vertical space on the Spatial Topology page. Add a collapse/expand toggle so the control panel can be hidden to maximize chart real estate. Also consider renaming the page to something shorter (e.g. "Topology" or "Map"). — Medium
- **Topology page — node selection rework**: The bottom section for picking and researching nodes is hard to use. Needs a full rework — easier node selection, clearer display of selected node details, and a path to launch the trade chart from a selected node. — Medium

- **Trade log**: New DB table to record each executed trade — which signal triggered it, signal price, execution price, exit price, drift on entry and exit. Extends the execution prompt in `active_signals.py`.

## Medium Priority

- **Parameter selection workflow**: After enough sweeps, need a way to review results across tickers and select parameter sets to trade — currently manual via logs/heatmaps
- **`trading_engine.py` cleanup**: Either retrofit or replace with Layer 3 implementation; currently points at legacy files

## Low Priority / Ideas

- **Advanced indicators**: Dataset size allows pre-computing Bollinger Bands, ATR, MACD etc. instantly via TA-Lib or pandas-ta (compiled C under the hood) — no hardware constraints
- **Basic ML experimentation**: Dataset small enough to train Random Forests or XGBoost on CPU in seconds if we want to explore signal prediction
- **Multi-ticker signal dashboard**: View current z-score signals across the full ticker universe in one place
- **Position sizing**: Layer 3 will eventually need a position sizing model
